# Students

Just a simple application to see how to build an application in PHP.

## Requirements

* PHP 8.1.12

## Run

    php app.php

When you type `end` or `quit` it will show the averages per course per student.

## Evaluation

The good:

* The OO part is nicely added to PHP (the Classes part).

The bad:

* Nothing yet.

The ugly:

* Documentation is not great. There is loads on `PHP.net` but it is really fragmented and all over the place. Stackoverflow was needed. But it is an old language so there is plenty.
* (Taste) I do not like the '.' as concatenation or `echo` to output something.
* It is function driven. `array_push` to add an element to a list, etc.
